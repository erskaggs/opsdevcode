What can I say?...without start crying.\
<br />
Russ was alwasy one of my best friends everytime we were together and even in spirit\
We "grew up" together.  I was always at my cousins house and I loved it because they were my brothers.\
The "McKenzie" boys as they were know within the family and I loved every part of them.\
But Russ with us being so close in age was a different story.  When dealing with his friends\
He always looked out for me and protected me.  He was the best to be a kid with wether its just\
explorying Hillsboro or even at my parents house he made everything better.\
<br />
Even as we got older once him and I saw each other it was over and we were right back\
into being kids again and just talking about everything.\
It wouldn't matter how long it was since we've seen each other it was always the same and we\
were right back into best friends and family.\
That was just one of the best part of him is to pick right back up, no matter how long and\
no matter what has happened.\
<br />
The fact that I would always be so estatic that I knew he would be there and now I know \
that I'll never get to that big squeeze from him, or that yell from him saying \
"thats my cuz".  He'll always be one of my heros just because of who he IS.\
<br />
There's so much that I wish I could just talk to Russ about and I HATE that\
I never took that opportunity and wasted what I thought was going to be around\
for as long as I can imagine.
